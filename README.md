# Heart-Failure-Prediction
Mangagement of Heart Failure prediction based on integrative data science
In this project I developed predictive models to estimate the potential occurrence of Heart Failure(HF) after six months in patients who experienced an  Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). I analyzed some clinical and lncRNAs through machine learning models and statistical techniques. Eventually I developed and configured a system that predicts the occurrence of HF in AMI patients.
